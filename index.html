<h1>Welcome Eli and Anna's Family project</h1>

<h2>A begginer's online family adventure </h2>

<p> We are a married couple, in love with each other and life. <br>
	Over the years we worked in different countries and had stnadart jobs <br>, in standart professions. When we found out <strong> <em> we miss each other a lot at work </em> </strong>, <br> we rezlied we need to do something for a living together. <br>  </p> <br>

	<p> We than decided it's about time we learn something we both enjoy <br> to do. Since Eli loves computers and Anna loves drawings - we took two <br> Udemy courses. One for web development and one for ilustrations and graphic design. <br> One of us is studying how to build websites and web applications, the other is <br> studying how to illustrate and make beautiful graphic design.  <br> </p>

	<p> We both hope to work together at home as freelancers, and this is a unique <br> portfolio. It shows both our skills- Eli's as a web developer and Anna's <br> as an illustrator and graphic designer.</p>

	<p> <strong> <em> <font color="#FF4500"> Eli Vidal says: </font></em> </strong>To those of you who are interested in a web developer- <br>please view the code of this website, and appriciate it's design and layout. <br> It is done with the best of my skill at the moment you are viewing the site <br> The more I improve, the better the site will look </p> <br>

My skills might not be perfect at this <br> moment - but they constantly improve and I promise I will do any design <br> job to the best of my expertise and more! </p> <br>
